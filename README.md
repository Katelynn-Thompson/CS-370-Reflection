In the Pirate Intelligent Agent project, I was provided with a foundational environment in Python using TensorFlow and Keras libraries for simulating a maze. This environment included a pre-designed 8x8 matrix maze where specific cells were marked as occupied (untraversable), free, or designated as targets. My role involved developing the machine learning component to navigate this maze.
Personal Code Creation:
Q-Training Algorithm: I crafted the Q-learning algorithm to enable the agent to learn the best paths through the maze based on rewards and penalties. This involved setting up the state space, action choices, reward system, and learning mechanism using deep reinforcement learning techniques.
Deep Q-Network Implementation: I designed and implemented a neural network model to approximate the Q-value function, which helped the agent learn from its environment and decide on the best actions.
Connection to Computer Science
Role and Impact of Computer Scientists: Computer scientists like myself contribute to advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning, and they are pivotal in solving complex, dynamic problems across various domains. The work done in developing intelligent agents matters as it pushes the boundary of what automated systems can achieve, enhancing decision-making processes and optimizing operations in industries like logistics, manufacturing, and autonomous navigation.
Approach to Problem-Solving: In tackling the Pirate Intelligent Agent project, I approached the problem with a systematic breakdown:
Environment Analysis: Understanding the maze structure and the rules governing the agent's movements.
Algorithm Design: Selecting and adapting algorithms that suit the problem constraints, in this case, Q-learning.
Implementation and Iteration: Coding the solution, testing, and refining the model based on its performance within the simulated environment.
Ethical Responsibilities:
To End Users: Ensuring that the intelligent agent behaves predictably and safely, especially if such technology were to be deployed in real-world scenarios where unexpected agent behavior could lead to risks.
To the Organization: Maintain transparency in how the model was developed, ensure it is robust and reliable, and accurately document the limitations and capabilities.
Conclusion
This project deepened my technical skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning and highlighted the importance of ethical considerations in AI development. As computer science students, we're not just solving technical problems but also shaping the future interaction between humans and machines, emphasizing the need for responsible and ethical AI development that considers the broader impacts on society and individual lives.
